## Introduction

This is assignment #1 for the John Hopkins Reproducible Research course on https://class.coursera.org/repdata-007 . 


This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

A single persons data was available and prescribed analysis required.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this
dataset.

## Assignment

I trust you have read the assignment (or you can review at https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1 ) and are involved in a peer review. Thanks and good luck for your own work.  

I have followed the assignment questions but my ordering is slightly different as I have directed it to allow comparion of the raw data (that with all the NA - not available readings) and the data filled with some (arbitary) filling algorithm. To do this I am plotting comparison panel plots of the raw and filled data while keeping to the guideline of just 3 plots.

As requested please follow the assignment in the markdown
