## Introduction

This is assignment #1 for the John Hopkins Reproducible Research course on https://class.coursera.org/repdata-007 . 


This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

A single persons data was available and prescribed analysis required.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this
dataset.

## Assignment

I trust you have read the assignment (or you can review at https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1 ) and are involved in a peer review. Thanks and good luck for your own work.  

I have followed the assignment but hope my ordering is ok. To compare the raw data (that with all the NA - not available readings) and the data filled with some (arbitary) filling algorithm I have changed the ordering slighly. This is to allow for plotting comparison panel plots of the raw and filled data while keeping to the guideline of just 3 plots.


### Loading and preprocessing the data
### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
### What is the average daily activity pattern?
### Imputing missing values
### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
eg to get to a plot. as opposed to the plots cached from R Markdown

## Submitting the Assignment

1. Commit your completed `PA1_template.Rmd` file to the `master` branch of your git repository (you should already be on the `master` branch unless you created new ones)

2. Commit your `PA1_template.md` and `PA1_template.html` files produced by processing your R markdown file with the `knit2html()` function in R (from the **knitr** package)

3. If your document has figures included (it should) then they should have been placed in the `figures/` directory by default (unless you overrode the default). Add and commit the `figures/` directory to your git repository.

4. Push your `master` branch to GitHub.

5. Submit the URL to your GitHub repository for this assignment on the course web site.

In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will
need to submit the 40 character SHA-1 hash (as string of numbers from
0-9 and letters from a-f) that identifies the repository commit that
contains the version of the files you want to submit. You can do this
in GitHub by doing the following:

1. Go into your GitHub repository web page for this assignment

2. Click on the "?? commits" link where ?? is the number of commits you have in the repository. For example, if you made a total of 10 commits to this repository, the link should say "10 commits".

3. You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository. The most recent commit is at the very top. If this represents the version of the files you want to submit, then just click the "copy to clipboard" button on the right hand side that should appear when you hover over the SHA-1 hash. Paste this SHA-1 hash into the course web site when you submit your assignment. If you don't want to use the most recent commit, then go down and find the commit you want and copy the SHA-1 hash.

A valid submission will look something like (this is just an **example**!)
